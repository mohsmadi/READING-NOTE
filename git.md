**Git** *is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.*

## Version Control
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. ... Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.

- **Local Version Control**
Local VCS is an approach that the user keep it's own file or saved the file by it's own self, they manage they own file. But it is hard to maintenance the changes of the file. We can just accidentally replace other file that actually we need.
- **Centralized Version Control**
are based on the idea that there is a single “central” copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server), and programmers will “commit” their changes to this central copy. “Committing” a change simply means recording the change in the central system
- **Distributed Version Control**
A distributed version control system (DVCS) is a type of version control where the complete codebase — including its full version history — is mirrored on every developer's computer. ... Changes to files are tracked between computers
